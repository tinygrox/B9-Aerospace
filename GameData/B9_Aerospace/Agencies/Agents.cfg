  description = #B9_AGENT_Desc//Major defense contractor and industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in aerospace projects. The corporation first made its reputation in conventional aviation, developing widely used MK2 and HL designs, but eventually branched out into space projects, specializing in highly sophisticated shuttle orbiters and spaceplanes. It is credited for development of the groundbreaking SABRE engine that enabled hundreds of spaceplane projects and multiple other breakthroughs. Lately, with the goals of the Kerbin space industry growing bigger by the day, Tetragon Projects introduced a set of colossal designs enabling space station construction, colonies and mothership-class interplanetary vehicles. The aviation branch continues to be active, delivering advanced upgrades to existing aircraft.
