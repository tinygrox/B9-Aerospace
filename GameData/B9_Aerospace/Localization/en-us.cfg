        #B9_AGENT_Title = Tetragon Projects
        #B9_AGENT_Desc = Major defense contractor and industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in aerospace projects. The corporation first made its reputation in conventional aviation, developing widely used MK2 and HL designs, but eventually branched out into space projects, specializing in highly sophisticated shuttle orbiters and spaceplanes. It is credited for development of the groundbreaking SABRE engine that enabled hundreds of spaceplane projects and multiple other breakthroughs. Lately, with the goals of the Kerbin space industry growing bigger by the day, Tetragon Projects introduced a set of colossal designs enabling space station construction, colonies and mothership-class interplanetary vehicles. The aviation branch continues to be active, delivering advanced upgrades to existing aircraft.

        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_M27_desc = Versatile two-seat cockpit for complex vessel designs. The story behind this part is unclear, but it looks like Kerbal engineers were very influenced by some sci-fi flick. Or maybe it's a prop raided straight from the set.

        #B9_Aerospace_Structure_StackSeparator_MSR_title = MSR Multipurpose Stacked Booster
        #B9_Aerospace_Structure_StackSeparator_MSR_desc = Stack separator and a set of boosters packed into one part. Not a particularly useful thing, mostly suitable for exotic applications like multi-stage probes. Beyond that, it's packed with extendable fins, which have no use and just make it more likely for the thing to hit something. Unless that's what you're looking for - then it's a nice replacement for good old sepratron-powered missiles.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_DockingPort_CDP_title = CDP Shielded Docking Port
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_DockingPort_CDP_desc = Aerodynamically shielded docking port. Developed for use with S2 fuselage system.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_InfoDrive_title = Info Drive
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_InfoDrive_desc = Displays editable pop-up window on craft launch. Press [ o ] to show/hide it, or, alternatively, use action group editor. The window will be automatically closed after a certain time. Useful for leaving descriptions of your weird action group setups, optimal ascent profiles, or just background stories of your creations for other users to see.
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_InfoDrive_textHeading = Craft Information
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_InfoDrive_textBody = Press [ o ] to toggle this window.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Leg_H50_title = H50-A Landing Leg
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Leg_H50_desc = Landing leg for heavy landers. We aren't sure how you got things like these into space in the first place, but this thing will help to get them back onto the ground. This model extends vertically and should be attached to the side of your lander.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Leg_H50P_title = H50-B Landing Leg
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Leg_H50P_desc = Landing leg for excessively heavy landers. We aren't sure how you got things like these into space in the first place, but this thing will help to get them back onto the ground. Probably. This model extends perpendicularly and should be attached to the underside of your lander.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A1_Closed_title = A1S Enclosed Spot Light
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A1_Closed_desc = Stylish, wide and powerful spotlight for your everyday needs.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A1_White_title = A1 Spot Light
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A1_White_desc = Stylish, wide and powerful spotlight for your everyday needs.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A4_White_title = A4 Spot Light Array
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A4_White_desc = Powerful array comprised of four spotlights.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A8_White_title = A8 Spot Light Array
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_A8_White_desc = Powerful array comprised of eight spotlights.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_N1_White_title = N1 Small Omni Light
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_N1_White_desc = Tired of spotlights so powerful they occasionally light up planetary surfaces from orbit? Here is a small light for your everyday needs. Attach anywhere you want, toggle with action groups, go bananas.

        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_N1_Large_White_title = N2 Large Omni Light
        #B9_Aerospace_Utility_Light_N1_Large_White_desc = Tired of spotlights so powerful they occasionally light up planetary surfaces from orbit? Here is a small light for your everyday needs. Attach anywhere you want, toggle with action groups, go bananas.

        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_MK2_Nosecone_Science_title = MK1 Nosecone - Atmospheric Science Package
        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_MK2_Nosecone_Science_desc = This nosecone packs the scientific equipment for monitoring and analysis of the atmospheric conditions.

        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_MK2_Nosecone_ASAS_title = MK1 Nosecone - Sensor Package
        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_MK2_Nosecone_ASAS_desc = A wide array of scientific instruments was conveniently packed into this 1.25m nosecone, including the accelerometer and pressure, temperature and gravity sensors.

        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_MK2_Nosecone_title = MK1 Nosecone
        #B9_Aerospace_Cockpit_MK2_Nosecone_desc = Simple nosecone which, depending on aerodynamics model you choose to believe (it better be FAR) can greatly help you to produce something flyable.

        #B9_Aerospace_Control_ASAS_title = Atmospheric Science Package
        #B9_Aerospace_Control_ASAS_desc = Previously a housing for advanced flight computers, this part was repurposed to carry the scientific equipment for monitoring and analysis of the atmospheric conditions..

        #B9_Aerospace_Control_ACU_title = Sensor Package
        #B9_Aerospace_Control_ACU_desc = Previously a housing for advanced flight computers, this part was repurposed to carry a wide array of scientific instruments, including the accelerometer and pressure, temperature and gravity sensors.
